                <h2>Flowers For Algernon</h2>
                <p>
                    I had a test today. I think I faled it and I think mabye now they wont use
                    me. What happind is I went to Prof Nemurs office on my lunch time like they
                    said and his secertery took me to a place that said psych dept on the door
                    with a long hall and alot of littel rooms with onley a desk and chares. And
                    a nice man was in one of the rooms and he had some wite cards with ink spilld
                    all over them. He sed sit down Charlie and make yourself cunfortible and
                    rilax. He had a wite coat like a docter but I dont think. he was no docter
                    because he dint tell me to opin my mouth and say ah. All he had was those
                    wite cards. His name is Burt. I fergot his last name because I dont remembir
                    so good.
                    I dint know what he was gonna do and I was holding on tite to the chair like
                    sometimes when I go to a dentist onley Burt aint no dentist neither but he
                    kept telling me to rilax and that gets me skared because it always means its
                    gonna hert.
                    So Burt sed Charlie what do you see on this card. I saw the spilld ink and
                    I was very skared even tho I got my rabits foot in my pockit because when I
                    was a kid I always faled tests in school and I spilld ink to.
