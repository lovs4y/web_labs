                    "Who is John Galt?"
                    The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could not distinguish the bum's face. The bum had said it simply,
                    without expression. But from the sunset far at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the
                    eyes looked straight at Eddie Willers, mocking and still‚Äîas if the question had been addressed to the
                    causeless uneasiness within him.
                    "Why did you say that?" asked Eddie Willers, his voice tense.
                    The bum leaned against the side of the doorway; a wedge of broken glass behind him reflected the metal
                    yellow of the sky.
                    "Why does it bother you?" he asked.
                    "It doesn't," snapped Eddie Willers.
                    He reached hastily into his pocket. The bum had stopped him and asked for a dime, then had gone on
                    talking, as if to kill that moment and postpone the problem of the next. Pleas for dimes were so frequent
                    in the streets these days that it was not necessary to listen to explanations, and he had no desire to hear
                    the details of this bum's particular despair.
                    "Go get your cup of coffee," he said, handing the dime to the shadow that had no face.
                    "Thank you, sir," said the voice, without interest, and the face leaned forward for a moment. The face
                    was wind-browned, cut by lines of weariness and cynical resignation; the eyes were intelligent. Eddie
                    Willers walked on, wondering why he always felt it at this time of day, this sense of dread without reason.
                    No, he thought, not dread, there's nothing to fear: just an immense, diffused apprehension, with no source
                    or object. He had become accustomed to the feeling, but he could find no explanation for it; yet the bum
                    had spoken as if he knew that Eddie felt it, as if he thought that one should feel it, and more: as if he knew
                    the reason.
                    Eddie Willers pulled his shoulders straight, in conscientious self-discipline. He had to stop this, he
                    thought; he was beginning to imagine things. Had he always felt it? He was thirty-two years old. He tried
                    to think back. No, he hadn't; but he could not remember when it had started. The feeling came to him
                    Suddenly, at random intervals, and now it was coming more often than ever. It's the twilight, he thought; I
                    hate the twilight.
                    The clouds and the shafts of skyscrapers against them were turning brown, like an old painting in oil, the
                    color of a fading masterpiece. Long streaks of grime ran from under the pinnacles down the slender,
                    soot-eaten walls. High on the side of a tower there was a crack in the shape of a motionless lightning, the
                    length of ten stories. A jagged object cut the sky above the roofs; it was half a spire, still holding the glow
                    of the sunset; the gold leaf had long since peeled off the other half. The glow was red and still, like the
