# Web Design - Lab 2

### Description

In this part I have implemented login page logic, registration page logic and user profile logic.
The code based on MVC pattern, and local storage to store all users and current user

### Getting stared

##### Login 
Use `login.html` to start working with application.
Predefined login and password:
- login: `admin` pass: `1234`
- login `user` pass `abcd`

##### Registration
Then, if you need to register new on, you can use `register` button to get to the registration page.

> Note:
> when you registering user, it's password will be the same as login

- The Home icon gets you back to home page
- The door icon logs out you
